# JailbreakScraper Component

## Component Name

JailbreakScraper

## Description

The JailbreakScraper component is designed to scrape the top 10 prompts from the jailbreakchat.com website. It inherits from the AbstractComponent base class and implements the `transform()` method to process the input data and return the output data.

## Input and Output Models

### Input Model
The input model for the JailbreakScraper component is defined by the class `JailbreakScraperInputDict`, which is an empty class that inherits from BaseModel.

### Output Model
The output model for the JailbreakScraper component is defined by the class `JailbreakScraperOutputDict`, which has a single attribute `top_10_prompts` of type List[str].

## Parameters

The JailbreakScraper component does not have any parameters.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` method takes an instance of `JailbreakScraperInputDict` as its input argument and follows these steps:

1. Define the URL for the website to scrape.
2. Send an HTTP GET request to the URL using the requests library.
3. Parse the HTML content of the response using the BeautifulSoup library.
4. Find all "div" elements with the class "prompt".
5. Sort the prompts based on their "jbscore", in descending order.
6. Extract the top 10 prompts and their associated "jbscore" values.
7. Return the extracted top 10 prompts in a `JailbreakScraperOutputDict` instance.

## External Dependencies

The JailbreakScraper component uses the following external libraries:

- `os`: For loading environment variables.
- `yaml`: For YAML parsing and processing.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `bs4`: For HTML parsing and data extraction.
- `typing`: For type annotations.
- `dotenv`: For environment variable management.
- `fastapi`: For creating the web application (API) in which the component is hosted.
- `pydantic`: For data validation and serialization with the use of input and output models.

## API Calls

The JailbreakScraper component makes a single API call to the jailbreakchat.com website using the requests library:

- HTTP GET request to the URL `https://www.jailbreakchat.com/`

This call fetches the HTML content of the jailbreakchat homepage.

## Error Handling

The JailbreakScraper component does not explicitly handle errors or exceptions. However, if there are any issues with the requests, parsing, or data extraction, the corresponding exceptions from the respective libraries will be raised.

## Examples

To use the JailbreakScraper component within a Yeager Workflow, you can follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the `JailbreakScraper` class.
2. Create an `JailbreakScraperInputDict` instance, passing any necessary configurations or input data.
3. Call the `transform()` method passing the input instance and store the result in a variable.
4. Access the `top_10_prompts` attribute of the returned `JailbreakScraperOutputDict` instance to get the extracted top 10 prompts.
