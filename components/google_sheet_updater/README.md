# Component Name

GoogleSheetUpdater

# Description

The GoogleSheetUpdater component is a building block of a Yeager Workflow responsible for updating a Google Sheet with sorted jailbreak rating data. It takes in a dictionary containing jailbreak names with their respective ratings, sorts the data, clears and updates the provided Google Sheet, and finally returns the updated Google Sheet ID.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

- _GoogleSheetUpdaterInputDict_: A Pydantic BaseModel with a single attribute:
    - _jailbreakRaterData_: A dictionary containing jailbreak names as keys and their respective ratings as values.

## Output Model

- _GoogleSheetUpdaterOutputDict_: A Pydantic BaseModel with a single attribute:
    - _updatedSheetId_: A string representing the updated Google Sheet ID.

# Parameters

- _googleSheetId_: The ID of the Google Sheet to be accessed and updated (type: string).
- _updateFrequency_: How often the Google Sheet should be updated (type: integer).

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method processes the input data and performs the following steps to update the Google Sheet:

1. Sorts the jailbreaks by their ratings in descending order.
2. Retrieves the access credentials for the Google Sheet.
3. Accesses the Google Sheet using its ID.
4. Clears the existing contents of the Google Sheet and adds a new header row with appropriate column names.
5. Iterates through the sorted list of jailbreaks and appends each jailbreak to the Google Sheet with its rating.
6. Returns the updated Google Sheet ID as an output.

# External Dependencies

- `pydantic`: For defining input and output data models.
- `fastapi`: For creating the FastAPI application.
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
- `google.oauth2`: For accessing the Google Sheets API using service account credentials.
- `googleapiclient.discovery`: For building the Google Sheets API client.

# API Calls

The component makes the following Google Sheets API calls:

1. Retrieving the Google Sheet using the provided ID.
2. Clearing the existing contents of the Google Sheet.
3. Appending the new header row to the Google Sheet.
4. Appending each sorted jailbreak and its rating to the Google Sheet.

# Error Handling

The component currently does not explicitly handle errors. If an error occurs during the API calls or data transformation, an exception will be thrown by the respective libraries, and the component will not proceed further.

# Examples

To use the `GoogleSheetUpdater` component in a Yeager Workflow, ensure you have configured the input data (`GoogleSheetUpdaterInputDict`) with the appropriate jailbreak rating dictionary, and then call the `transform()` method, like so:
