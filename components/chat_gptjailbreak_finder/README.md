# ChatGPT Jailbreak Finder Component

## 1. Component Name
ChatGPTJailbreakFinder

## 2. Description
This component is designed to find and update the Jailbreak entries within a Google Sheet using Google APIs. It is a part of the Yeager Workflow and inherits the AbstractWorkflow base class. The purpose is to process input arguments in the form of a Google API key, perform data processing and transformation, and return the updated Google Sheet ID as an output.

## 3. Input and Output Models
This component uses two Pydantic data models for input and output validation and serialization.

### Input Model:
- `ChatGPTJailbreakFinderIn` contains one field:
    - `GoogleApiKey` (str): The Google API key required to access and modify the Google Sheet.

### Output Model:
- `ChatGPTJailbreakFinderOut` contains one field:
    - `UpdatedGoogleSheetId` (str): The ID of the updated Google Sheet.

## 4. Parameters
This component does not have any parameters that need to be configured.

## 5. Transform Function
The `transform()` function is an asynchronous method that processes input arguments and performs the following steps:

1. Calls the `super().transform()` method with the input arguments and callbacks.
2. Retrieves the Google Sheet ID from the result dictionary.
3. Creates an instance of the output model with the updated Google Sheet ID.
4. Returns the output model instance.

## 6. External Dependencies
This component has the following external dependencies:

- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
- `fastapi`: For creating a FastAPI application.
- `pydantic`: For defining input and output data models.
- `core.workflows.abstract_workflow`: For the AbstractWorkflow base class.

## 7. API Calls
This component does not make any API calls directly. However, it expects the base class `AbstractWorkflow` to implement the required API calls and return the data in the `results_dict`.

## 8. Error Handling
Error handling is not directly implemented in this component. It is expected to be managed within the base class `AbstractWorkflow` or in callback functions.

## 9. Examples
To use the ChatGPTJailbreakFinder component in a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Import the component and required classes:
